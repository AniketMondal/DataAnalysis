# DataAnalysis
Contains cleaning, transformation and exploratory analysis of various data sets using Python Pandas, NumPy, re, random, etc.<br/><br/>
Each directory has the actual raw data set, the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and the exported Excel file having analyzed data in different sheets.<br/><br/>
This is as a practice of data analysis and fine-tuning my data skills.
