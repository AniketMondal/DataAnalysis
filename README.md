# DataAnalysis
Contains cleaning, transformation and exploratory analysis of various data sets using Python Pandas, NumPy, re, random, etc. Each directory has the actual raw data set, the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and the exported Excel file having analyzed data in different sheets.
This is as a practice of data analysis, fine-tuning my data skills and learn from experience.
